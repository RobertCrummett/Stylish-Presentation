## About Stylish-Presentation
My research group, the [Center of Gravity, Electrical and Magnetic Studies](https://cgem.mines.edu/) (CGEM) at the Colorado School of Mines, has a distinct color pallete for our presentations â€“ black bacground, white and light blue text. The `Stylish-Presentation` repository contains all of the code necessary to build a [LuaTeX](https://www.luatex.org/) [Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer?lang=en) presentation with our color theme, fonts, and logos already formatted.

My initial intent with this project was to practice my TeX coding. However, in the process of studying LaTeX, I cam across a powerful dialect called [LuaTeX](https://www.luatex.org/), a TeX engine integrated with the scripting language Lua. Long story short, a weekend project turned into a weeklong project, and ultimately a spiffy and extendable `*.cls` package for CGEM research presentations.
