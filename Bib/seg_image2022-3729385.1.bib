    abstract = { For many research, exploration, or engineering projects with limited funding, it is common to use an acquisition design with observations on several 2D lines, either in parallel or in a cross-line pattern. Such acquisition patterns are intuitive and easy to implement, but they cannot collect sufficient information about 3D geology. This difficulty can be alleviated by using our newly developed ergodic sampling using irregular samples. Ergodic sampling theory uses optimization to form sparse irregular patterns that maximize the information contained in the same number of samples. A specific application of the ergodic sampling theory is to re-arrange the same number of stations in a cross-line pattern to form a new sampling pattern that can be much more effective in data acquisition. Our simulations using field data show that shifting from cross-line pattern to our irregular acquisition design can increase the information content by as much as 10 times. This irregular acquisition design significantly changes the perspective of what a small-budge data collection can accomplish with a couple of hundreds stations. Such projects will no longer be limited to only a few lines of 2D information anymore. Instead, it is possible to acquire true 3D geological information in such cases. Thus, our irregular acquisition design based on ergodic sampling theory can enable more scientific research as well as engineering and exploration projects with limited budgets. }
